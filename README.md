# Password Generator

## This project was made to generate random passwords after following a series of prompts. The application starts by asking the user how long they would like the password to be, then which types of charactes they would like to use. Once the user has gone through all the prompts, the generator returns a password using the qualifying characters.

## This project helped me learn for loops and how to use them. It also challenged me to use arrays and take values from them.
